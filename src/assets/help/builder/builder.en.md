# Builder

The builder is one of the backbones of XIV-RH, allowing you to build custom rotations using the 4 different phases
Prepull, Opener, Cooldown and Burst.

## UI walkthrough

1) **New:** Resets your current progress and allows you to build a new rotation from scratch.
2) **Try out:** Opens the rotation hero player and allows you to test run your current rotation.
3) **Save:** Saves your rotation. Note that this requires you to have a user account on the site and Title and
   Description need to be filled out.
4) **Record:** Enables recording of actions. Triggering an action during record will add the triggered action to the
   phase which is currently marked as record enabled.
5) **Toggle meta info:** Collapses the Title and Description to not be visible. Useful when you don't have much space.
6) **Title:** The title of your rotation. Try to make it as useful as possible.
7) **Description:** Describe the specifics of your rotation.
8) **Collapse Phase View:** Allows you to collapse or expand a phase for a more compact view.
9) **Phase name:** The name of the phase.
10) **Record enabled:** Marks if this phase is the target when recording. Click on any record enable button to change
    the target for recording.
11) **Exclude phase:** Excludes a phase from appearing in a rotation. Note, that this button is primarily useful if you
    want to test drive something and a phase already contains actions as empty phases are automatically excluded.
12) **DRAG ACTIONS HERE:** Well, drag actions which should be in your rotation here. You can reorder them as you like at
    any time or right click any action to remove it from this area.
