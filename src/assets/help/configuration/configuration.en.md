# Configuration

You can access the configuration dialog by clicking on configuration in the toolbar. All configurations you do are
persisted **locally**, that means, reloading your browser should bring you right back to where you left. The following
things are persisted:

- Configuration settings
- Hotbar positions
- Hotbar assignments per job class
- Selected job

The configuration menu works exactly as in the game here. For further details on all configuration options you can go to
the sub-articles "Display configuration", "Cross hotbar configuration" and "Custom configuration".
