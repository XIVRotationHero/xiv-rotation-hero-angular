## Cross hotbar controls

**Hold:** You have to hold the L/R trigger buttons while pressing another key.

**Toggle:** You press L/R once and let go, you do not need to hold down the triggers to trigger an action.

## W cross hotbar display settings

### Always display WXHB

If enabled, will always show the wide cross hotbar. You can select which hotbar is shown in the custom settings.

### Return to XHB after WXHB input

If enabled, after interacting with the WXHB it will automatically jump back to the cross hotbar. So, if for example, you
double tap RT and keep it held it will allow you to execute an action on the right WXHB while then jumping to the right
XHB.

### Position WXHB separately from XHB

If enabled, the WXHB elements are separated from the cross hotbar and you can position them separately on the screen.

### WXHB input timer

This specifies the time in 10ms increments on how long a double tap can take to trigger the WXHB. Note that anything
below 15 is really hard to actually trigger and the recommendation is to put it around 25.
