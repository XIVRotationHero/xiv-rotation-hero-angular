# Using Rotation Hero in ACT

There are 2 ways to run XIV-RH in ACT, which are personalised and non-personalised.

## Non-personalised

This is the default way XIV-RH behaves when you just include `https://app.xivrotationhero.com/player` as the URL for
your MiniParse overlay.

It is the preferred way, if you just want to check out how it works or do not want to create your own rotations or
favorite community ones.

### Setup

1) Start ACT
2) Click on the Plugins tab.
3) In the now appearing new tabs, click on OverlayPlugin.dll
   <img src="/assets/help/using-rotation-hero/in-act/act-tabs.png" />
4) Now in the bottom left, click on New and a dialog will open.
5) In the Dialog, choose anything for name (XIV-RH if you can't think of one)
6) For the preset, you want to choose the bottom most option custom.
7) For the now appearing type, select MiniParse.
8) Click on OK and a new entry will appear in the list on the left side of the main window.
9) Click on the new entry
10) Paste `https://app.xivrotationhero.com/player` into the URL field.
11) Click on Reload overlay and the overlay should appear in the top left corner.
12) There is no further step, you're done.

## Personalised

You should prefer using the personalised approach when you want to favorite rotations or access rotations you've built
yourself.

This requires that you register an account or sign up through one of the third party login providers. To get a
personalised version, follow the steps above and when pasting the URL, paste your personalised URL instead. You can find
this when you click on your username located in the top right corner.
