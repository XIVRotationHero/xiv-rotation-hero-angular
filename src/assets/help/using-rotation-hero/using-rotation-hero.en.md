# Using Rotation Hero

There are basically two distinct ways on how you can use XIV-RH although both kinda go hand in hand.

### If you're playing on PC and don't use ACT OR you're playing on console

As you can't have overlays on the console in this case you're bound to use the browser version.

However, for the gamepad users XIV-RH has full gamepad support, so you can practice with your controller the same way
you would play on console or PC when you prefer controllers. For this, the whole cross hotbar settings are mimicking the
games settings to give you the closest experience practicing which is possible.

For Gamepad support, it is highly recommended you use the Chrome browser.

### If you're playing on PC and you use ACT

This is the best case scenario for you. You can just jump in and add `https://app.xivrotationhero.com/player`
as an overlay URL to have Rotation Hero running as an overlay and practice already published rotations from the
community on a training dummy.

Or, you could sign up an account and favourite your rotations to get a personalised ACT Overlay URL which will grant you
access to your own created rotations and favorites.
