# Using Rotation Hero in the browser

The browser version tries to mimic the games UI in some sort of way. As such, almost everything is a window which you
can toggle through the toolbar at the top.

Notice that by default on your first visit, most of the page will be blank. To get started you first have to push some
buttons.

## Selecting your job

To get started, you have to first select a job in the top left corner.

<img src="/assets/help/using-rotation-hero/in-the-browser/select-job-toggle.png" />

Click on it to reveal a dropdown of available jobs and select one. If this job wasn't already selected previously, it
will now also automatically allocate all job actions which can be assigned to a hotbar.

## Adjusting your hotbars

You can adjust your hotbars on XIV-RH exactly like you can in the game. This means you can:

- Drag hotbars around
- Drag actions between hotbars
- Drag actions from the actions window
- Disable or enable hotbars from the configuration window
- Or change the layout of hotbars from the configuration window

Give it a try by clicking a little around, you'll see that it behaves almost like in game.
